## Initial Setup

- ⚠️Make sure to `npm i` after you clone to your local machine.
- Note that unused stock CRA (Create React App) files have been removed.

- Utilizing the useState hook
- Relying on events that allow users to manipulate data, in this case, the ratings

## Material UI

We'll be using Material UI's [Rating Input](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/) to allow users to rate an anime.
